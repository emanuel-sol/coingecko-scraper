# coingecko-scraper
I created this web scraper to gather data about various tokens for a machine learning project and I figured other developers would find it useful as well. The selectors in main_gecko_scraper.py need to be modified since coingecko recently changed the layout of the webpages for all tokens. simple_gecko_scraper.py works as expected.
